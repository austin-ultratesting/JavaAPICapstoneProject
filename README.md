# Java API Capstone Project


A demo project to facilitate an Ultranaut's understanding on automation testing of API. The following goals are established in maintaining the project:

* A tutorial on basic API interactions written in Java
* Outlining a sample maven project that is maintained in a repository
* A written summary which will be hosted on the Ultra guide resource (a link will be provided later during future commits)

Stay tuned for more updates!
