# Java API Capstone Project

A demo project to facilitate an Ultranaut's understanding on automation testing of API. The following goals are established in maintaining the project:

* A tutorial on basic API interactions written in Java
* Outlining a sample maven project that is maintained in a repository
* A written summary which will be hosted on the Ultra guide resource (a link will be provided later during future commits)

This project utilizes an environment folder (not distributed in the repospitiry for obvious security reasons). If you plan to download the repository to test and work with it, please create an .env file within the project directory and have the following attributes:

* PERSONAL_USER_NAME = "Your github username"
* PERSONAL_API_KEY = "Your api key github generates. Permissions for the key need to be set to include repo and delete repo" 

Stay tuned for more updates!
